# Events-App
## The Project
#### I wanted to create something of my own to familiarise myself with both the front-end technologies I have been learning and make the use of GraphQL. 

#### Front-end was created bt React.js with stylings.
#### I set up  a GraphQL API server using Express and hard coded 15 events for front-end to display. 

##### This app was inspired by my passion for live music. I imagine a place where can host these events with my favourite artists at the moment.
