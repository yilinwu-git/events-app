# Events-App
## The Project

### Brief: 

#### I wanted to create something of my own to familiarise myself with both the front-end technologies I have been learning and make the use of GraphQL. 
#### Front-end was created with React.js with stylings. I also used react datepicker component to implement filtering.
#### I set up  a GraphQL API server using Express and hard coded 15 events for front-end to display. 

### Techonologies used in this project: 

#### - Frontend -
- Sass(Scss)/React-bootsrap
- React.js
- Apollo Client to manage data with GraphQL


#### - Backend -
- Node.js
- Express
- GraphQL

###### *This app was inspired by my passion for live music. I imagine a place where can host these events with my favourite artists at the moment.*
